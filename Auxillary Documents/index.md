Documentation specific todo list:
 - [ ] Teach guidelines how to push the files into the society documentation... again as the repository system was changed and better planned
 - [ ] How to use Obsidian, Markdown and get the files to be edited... again.
 - [ ] Make further style design changes, ie. pick the light mode colours, placement, mobile-friendliness
 - [ ] Add further links between documentation.
 - [ ] Add property function to TypeScript to display the author(s) of the documentation writers.
